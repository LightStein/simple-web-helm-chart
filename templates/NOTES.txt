Thank you for installing {{ .Chart.Name }}.

Your service has been deployed, and in a few minutes, it should be accessible through its external IP.

To retrieve the external IP of the LoadBalancer service, run the following command:
kubectl get svc {{ include "simple-web.fullname" . }}-svc -n {{ .Release.Namespace }} -o jsonpath='{.status.loadBalancer.ingress[0].ip}'

Alternatively, you can watch the service until the external IP is assigned:
kubectl get svc -w {{ include "simple-web.fullname" . }}-svc -n {{ .Release.Namespace }}

Once the external IP is available, your application can be accessed directly via:
http://<EXTERNAL_IP>

Additionally, if accessing via Ingress, your application is available at the following path:
http://<INGRESS_HOST>/thomas
